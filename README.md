#Cubbies

##What is Cubbies?

This repo contains a prototype of a project called **Cubbies**. The long-term objective of Cubbies is to allow anyone to create a handmade 3D virtual environment (a “cubby”) that they can spend time in and invite their friends to visit. The user can decorate their cubby however they want – for example, by putting art on the walls and choosing the furniture (and eventually, by laying out a floorplan or creating other sophisticated landscapes).

The capstone version of Cubbies is written for the PC. However, in the long term, Cubbies is intended as a 3D environment authoring and sharing tool intended primarily for virtual reality headsets.

##Who might use Cubbies?

Although Cubbies leverages much of the graphics and realtime rendering technology and know-how developed by the game industry, its target audience is fundamentally different. A specific objective of mine is to make Cubbies something that is fun for people (perhaps disproportionately girls and women) who want to do something in gorgeous 3D that does not involve shooting enemies or blowing stuff up. As a kid, I remember trying to use the Quake level editor to build a house. The living room of my house featured sofas made out of dungeon stone and a reflecting pool made out of toxic sludge, because those were the textures that were available.

My goal in Cubbies is to make an environment where people can be imaginative and creative, making spaces that are social, aesthetic, personally significant, or fun, rather than just a backdrop for violent live action.

##Are you going to keep working on this?

Hopefully!
